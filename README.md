# PowerBI-Financial-Performance-Dashboard

A Financial Performance Dashboard Project 
As part of my journey to enhance my data analytics skills, I recently undertook a Power BI project to create a comprehensive Financial Performance Dashboard. This project not only helped me deepen my understanding of data visualization techniques but also provided valuable insights into financial metrics and performance tracking. In this article, I will walk you through the steps I took to create this dashboard and the analysis I performed. 
Project Overview 
The goal of this project was to create a dashboard that provides a clear and concise view of the financial performance of an organization. The dashboard includes various metrics such as actual total sales, total sales target, variance, and variance percentage. It also displays year-to-date figures and trends over time, providing a holistic view of the organizationâ€™s financial health.

Key Components of the Dashboard 



Actual Total Sales: This metric shows the total sales achieved by the organization. For this project, the actual total sales amounted to $5.2 million.
Total Sales Target: This represents the sales target set for the organization. The target for this project was $5.4 million.
Variance and Variance Percentage: These metrics show the difference between the actual sales and the target sales. The variance was -$152,000, with a variance percentage of -2.83%. 4
Year-to-Date (Actual and Target): These metrics track the sales figures for the year to date. The actual year-to-date sales were $736,000, while the target was $845,000
Target Status by Date: This visualization shows whether the sales targets were met each month. It helps in identifying trends and patterns in sales performance over time
Team Performance: The dashboard also includes a section that highlights the performance of different teams within the organization. It shows how each team is performing against their targets
Salesperson Performance: This section tracks the performance of individual salespersons, providing insights into who is meeting or exceeding their targets. 
Steps Undertaken for Analysis

Data Collection and Preparation: The first step was to collect and prepare the data. This involved gathering sales data from various sources and ensuring it was clean and ready for analysis. I used Power Query in Power BI to clean and transform the data, making it suitable for visualization
Building the Dashboard: With the data prepared, I started building the dashboard. I used various visualizations such as bar charts, line charts and cards to represent the different metrics. The key was to ensure that the dashboard was easy to understand and provided a clear overview of the financial performance

Analysis and Insights: Once the dashboard was built, I analyzed the data to draw insights. For example, I noticed that out of 25 salespersons, 11 met their sales targets, indicating a 44% success rate. One salesperson, Kaine Padly, had the highest percentage variance of 9%, showing exceptional performance. I also found that the organization missed its monthly sales targets 12 out of 14 times. However, Team Yummies achieved their target 7 out of 14 times, outperforming other teams. Conclusion: This Power BI project was an excellent opportunity to enhance my data analytics skills and gain deeper insights into financial performance metrics. By creating this dashboard, I was able to visualize key financial data in a way that is both informative and actionable. Power BI is a powerful tool that can help you turn raw data into meaningful insights, driving better decision-making within your organization.
